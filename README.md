A simple back-tracking program built in Racket to find all solutions to ["The Ultimate Puzzle"](https://theultimatepuzzle.com/).
You can allow or disallow flipping pieces over from their natural face-up orientation.

Note that the version I solved is slightly different than the one linked above (see the pieces picture), and only has 9 pieces instead of 16.
I originally solved the one linked above several years prior to this one, but the code was neither organized nor commented.
